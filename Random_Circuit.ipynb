    "The basic function above prints the resulting circuit using Tequila's in-built circuit drawing tool. To get better circuit visualizations, specify a backend as shown in the cells below. There's obviously a lot of code repetition which can be easily cleaned up using helper functions.\n",
    "0. I have given a sample usage in the following cell. Feel free to change the inputs as desired. If needed, reference the list of supported gates by visiting the gate.py file in Tequila's documentation.\n",
    "1. I used the $2\\pi$ Phase gate to simulate the Identity operation, as it allows us additional randomness in our circuits, by simply choosing not to apply any gate to a qubit at some layer. \n",
    "2. Additional modifications can be made by specifying a probability distribution over the random sampling from the basis of gates.\n",
    "3. Another choice was made in deciding NOT to interpret unparametrized gates in the basis as their parametrized counterparts. In doing so, we retain an additional degree of flexibility which allows to specify both an unparametrixed gate and a parametrixed gate (e.g. both X and Rx) in the basis. This would be given by the (INCOMPLETE) `powers` option to the `random_circuit` function.\n",
    "4. For the first layer, I chose to exclude any controlled gates since they will not give any interesting results (assuming we start out in the zero state, like in Tequila). For depth-2 circuits, I chose to prioritize multi-qubit gates for the second layer. For all other cases, both multi-qubit and single-qubit, and controlled and non-controlled, gates were considered equally.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two more convenience choices which I would like to address. These choices were made in line to Tequila's founding principles, and the subsequent decisions to try implementing some of these convenience functions also imitates how Tequila decided to include some convenience functions upon user feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. The input list `basis_gates` must currently be given as a list of Tequila circuits / gates. However, the extension to providing a list of strings or a Union of both strings and Tequila objects is straightforward. In the code above, I have specified an obvious way in how to go about doing so. Currently, supported strings are X, Y, Z, Rx, Ry, Rz, H, and CNOT, but no other multi-qubit or controlled gates.\n",
    "6. Alternatively, another method for doing this would be to provide a parser which would parse strings into Tequila objects only once at the very start. "
